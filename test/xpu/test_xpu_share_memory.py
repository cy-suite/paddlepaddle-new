"""
A minimal unit test for testing XPU IPC sharing (_share_xpu and _new_shared_xpu).

This test uses the spawn start method to create two child processes
before the parent creates an XPU tensor. The parent then creates an XPU
tensor, calls _share_xpu to get IPC metadata, and sends that metadata to
the children via a multiprocessing.Queue. Each child sets its XPU device,
reconstructs the shared tensor using _new_shared_xpu, and verifies that its
content matches the expected value.
